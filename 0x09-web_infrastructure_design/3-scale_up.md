## Description

This web infrastructure is an enhanced and expanded version, designed to eliminate Single Points of Failure (SPOFs) and improve overall performance and security. In this architecture, each core component (web server, application server, and database server) is hosted on separate GNU/Linux servers. SSL encryption is maintained throughout the entire network, and robust firewalls protect each server, which are also under constant monitoring.

## Specifics About This Infrastructure

+ **Firewall Implementation Between Each Server**<br/>
  Each server in the infrastructure is safeguarded by its own firewall, providing an additional layer of security. This setup ensures that every server is independently protected from unauthorized access and potential threats, enhancing the overall security posture of the network.

+ **Separation of Major Components**<br/>
  By isolating the web server, application server, and database server onto individual servers, we improve resource allocation and performance. This separation also simplifies troubleshooting and maintenance, as issues can be more easily isolated to specific components.

+ **Comprehensive SSL Protection**<br/>
  SSL encryption is maintained throughout the entire data flow, from the client to the server and between servers, ensuring that all data transmitted within the network is secure. This continuous encryption protects against potential interception and data breaches.

## Issues With This Infrastructure

+ **Increased Maintenance and Operational Costs**<br/>
  The distributed nature of this infrastructure requires more servers, leading to higher initial costs for purchasing equipment. Additionally, ongoing operational expenses, including electricity and cooling, will increase. These costs can be significant, impacting the company's budget and resource allocation.
  
+ **Complexity in Management**<br/>
  Managing a distributed infrastructure with multiple servers can be more complex compared to a single-server setup. This complexity demands advanced skills from IT personnel and can increase the time required for routine maintenance and troubleshooting.
  
+ **Scalability Challenges**<br/>
  While the infrastructure is designed to scale, adding new servers and ensuring they integrate seamlessly with the existing setup requires careful planning and management. Ensuring consistent performance and security across all servers as the infrastructure grows can be challenging.

By addressing these challenges and maintaining best practices, this scaled-up infrastructure can offer robust performance, security, and reliability.
