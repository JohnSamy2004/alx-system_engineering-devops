# Web Infrastructure Design

## Description

This project showcases a collection of web infrastructure designs that can be implemented in various web development projects. Each design addresses different requirements and challenges, providing a comprehensive overview of potential web infrastructure setups.

## Designs Presented

### [Simple Web Stack](0-simple_web_stack.md)
A basic web infrastructure setup suitable for small-scale projects. This design focuses on simplicity and ease of deployment, hosting all components (web server, application server, and database) on a single server.

### [Distributed Web Infrastructure](1-distributed_web_infrastructure.md)
An enhanced setup aimed at reducing the load on a single server by distributing traffic across multiple servers. This design includes a load balancer and a replica server to improve performance and reliability.

### [Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure](2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure.md)
A security-focused design that incorporates firewalls, SSL certificates, and monitoring tools to protect the infrastructure from unauthorized access and ensure continuous performance monitoring.

### [Scaled Up Web Infrastructure](3-scale_up.md)
A robust and scalable infrastructure designed to eliminate Single Points of Failure (SPOFs) by separating major components onto individual servers. This design ensures high availability, security, and performance, suitable for large-scale projects.

Each design provides a detailed explanation of its components, configuration, and the specific issues it addresses, offering a comprehensive guide for implementing efficient and secure web infrastructures.
