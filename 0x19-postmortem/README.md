# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage - "Unexpected Downtime Due to Nginx Misconfiguration"

## Issue Summary

**Duration:** August 14, 2024, 14:00 UTC - August 14, 2024, 15:30 UTC (1 hour 30 minutes)

**Impact:** During the outage, 85% of users experienced an inability to access the website, with all requests returning a "502 Bad Gateway" error. The outage affected the primary web service, preventing access to the main application and causing a significant disruption to user activity.

**Root Cause:** The root cause was traced to a misconfiguration in the Nginx server. A recent update to the Nginx configuration file introduced an invalid directive, which caused Nginx to fail during startup, leading to the "502 Bad Gateway" error as the upstream application server was unreachable.

## Timeline

- **14:00 UTC:** Issue detected by automated monitoring systems (Pingdom alerts) indicating that the website was down.
- **14:02 UTC:** On-call engineer receives an alert and begins investigation.
- **14:10 UTC:** Initial investigation focused on checking server load and network connectivity, which appeared normal.
- **14:20 UTC:** The issue was escalated to the web operations team after determining that the Nginx server was not responding correctly.
- **14:25 UTC:** Misleading path: Engineers suspected a potential network issue between Nginx and the application server, but pings and traceroutes confirmed that the network was functioning properly.
- **14:35 UTC:** Further investigation revealed that Nginx was failing to start correctly after a recent configuration update.
- **14:40 UTC:** The team identified an incorrect directive in the Nginx configuration file that was incompatible with the current server setup.
- **14:45 UTC:** The problematic configuration was rolled back to a previous, working version.
- **15:00 UTC:** Nginx successfully restarted, and the web service began to recover.
- **15:30 UTC:** All services fully restored, with normal operation confirmed through monitoring.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The outage was caused by a recent change to the Nginx configuration file. A new directive was added to optimize load balancing, but it was improperly formatted and not supported by the current Nginx version. This caused Nginx to fail during its startup process, resulting in the "502 Bad Gateway" errors seen by users.

To resolve the issue, the team:
1. Identified the misconfiguration through a detailed review of the Nginx error logs.
2. Reverted the configuration to the last known good state.
3. Restarted the Nginx service, which restored access to the application.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent a similar issue from occurring in the future, the following steps will be implemented:

1. **Improve Configuration Validation:**
   - Implement automated syntax checks for Nginx configuration files before they are deployed.
   - Establish a staging environment where configuration changes can be tested before going live.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Add specific monitoring for Nginx startup failures to ensure quicker detection of similar issues.
   - Set up alerts for configuration changes, so the team is immediately notified of potential risks.

3. **Documentation and Training:**
   - Update internal documentation to include guidelines on safe Nginx configuration practices.
   - Provide training for engineers on how to safely update and validate configurations.

**TODO:**
- [ ] Implement a CI/CD pipeline with automated configuration validation for Nginx.
- [ ] Create a staging environment that mirrors the production setup.
- [ ] Update monitoring tools to include Nginx-specific error tracking.
- [ ] Conduct a training session on Nginx configuration best practices.
